    educationalText: `Ciphers are methods of transforming information to keep it secret from unintended recipients. At their core, ciphers work by replacing, rearranging, or otherwise altering the characters or structure of a message in a way that can only be reversed by someone who knows the specific rules—or "key"—used to encode it. There are two main types of ciphers: substitution ciphers, which replace each element of the plaintext with another character or symbol (as in the Caesar cipher), and transposition ciphers, which rearrange the order of characters in the message. In either case, the goal is to make the original message unreadable to anyone without the key.

Modern ciphers, used in digital communication and data protection, rely on complex mathematical algorithms and keys that are often hundreds or thousands of bits long. These encryption techniques ensure that even if a message is intercepted, decrypting it without the correct key would take impractical amounts of time and computing power. Cryptographic systems often use symmetric encryption (where the same key encrypts and decrypts) or asymmetric encryption (where a public key encrypts and a private key decrypts). Through these systems, ciphers play a foundational role in securing everything from online banking to private messaging.`,
